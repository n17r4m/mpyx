## üõ† Architectural Positives

* **Composable pipelines**: `EZ()` + `Indurate` let you build DAGs of processes from plain functions, sets/tuples/lists for broadcast/parallel/serial. That‚Äôs genuinely cool ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a poor man‚Äôs Dask/Ray but with a tiny footprint.
* **Lifecycle hooks**: `F.initialize`, `setup`, `do`, `teardown` is a nice clean separation of pre-fork vs. per-child init vs. work loop vs. cleanup.
* **Cross-cutting support**: `.meta` dict and `.xcut()` are clever ways to pass shared state and side-channels through a DAG.
* **Exception routing**: you actually tried to catch child exceptions and bubble them back up with `.catch()`. That‚Äôs a big deal compared to most DIY multiprocessing wrappers.
* **Utilities**: `Const`, `Iter`, `Filter`, `Batch`, `Zip` etc. make demo pipelines approachable.
* **Video module**: `Vid.py` / `Video.py` wrapping FFmpeg is ambitious; you went straight for hard mode by shoving raw video frames through queues.

## üß® The Bug/Fragility List

1. **Inheritance mistake**

   ```python
   super(Process, self).__init__()
   ```

   inside `F.__init__` is wrong ‚Äî you‚Äôre skipping `multiprocessing.Process.__init__`. Should be `super().__init__()`. This alone will cause subtle breakage on Windows (spawn) or when trying to `start()` processes.

2. **Async helpers** (`myAsync`, `async`, `async2`) are half-baked.

   * You call `run_until_complete()` on what might already be a coroutine or not.
   * `async2` is just `pass`.
   * Running event loops inside processes like this is a recipe for ‚Äúevent loop already running‚Äù errors.

3. **Queue management**

   * Mixing `JoinableQueue` and manual `task_done()` is fragile ‚Äî you call `.join()` on outputs in `shutdown()` without guaranteeing every `.put()` got matched with `.task_done()`. Classic deadlock hazard.
   * ProxyQueue is half-wrapped (no `.task_done()`, `.qsize()`, etc.).

4. **Busy-wait loops**

   * `while data is None and not self.done(): ... sched_yield()` = 100% CPU spin if queues are empty.
   * Same with `while not self.stopped():` in `run()`.

5. **Exception handling**

   * You `.put((e, traceback))` into a queue but then just `print` the traceback in a thread. No restart, no propagation, no structured logging.
   * Also, `handle_exception` tries `traceback.format_tb(e.__traceback__)` ‚Äî not always safe if `e.__traceback__` is `None`.

6. **Stop conditions**

   * `done()` checks `.finished()` of upstreams, but sources never set themselves as ‚Äúdone‚Äù properly (only `.stop()`). Easy to leave dangling workers that never exit.
   * Sink processes never `stop()` unless input is empty. Pipelines can hang forever.

7. **Video module**

   * You read raw bytes with `np.fromstring` (deprecated).
   * `stderr.read()` with `O_NONBLOCK` ‚Üí potential busy-poll spam.
   * You close stdin in `teardown()` but keep looping on `poll()`, risking hangs.
   * Memory pressure: moving 1080p frames through `JoinableQueue` is brutal (unpickling every frame).

8. **Code smells**

   * Functions named `async` shadow the Python keyword.
   * `info()` returns queue sizes, which on `multiprocessing.JoinableQueue` aren‚Äôt reliable (platform-dependent).
   * A lot of ‚ÄúNYI‚Äù stubs (3D rotations, `heur_max`, `hyperspace`‚Ä¶) suggest unfinished ideas.
   * Docs promise ‚Äúorders of magnitude‚Äù speedups ‚Äî but with this queue architecture, overhead is massive for small tasks.

## üöë How I‚Äôd Modernize It

* Replace the `Process` subclass with `multiprocessing.get_context("spawn").Process` + a worker fn. Drop `super(Process, self).__init__()`.
* Use `multiprocessing.Queue` with explicit sentinels instead of `JoinableQueue` + `task_done()` bookkeeping.
* Backpressure: set `maxsize` on queues, and use `.put(item, timeout=...)`.
* Exception model: have workers push `Result(ok=False, err=...)` objects back to parent. No threads needed.
* Drop `sched_yield` spin-loops. Replace with `queue.get(timeout=...)` + `Empty`.
* Don‚Äôt pass numpy frames via pickle ‚Äî use `multiprocessing.shared_memory` or a ringbuffer (`multiprocessing.Array`).
* For async integration: better to run an `asyncio` event loop in the *parent*, not inside each process.
* Adopt structured logging (queue + `logging.handlers.QueueHandler`).
* If you want real scaling: integrate with `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` and just add your DAG syntax sugar on top.

## üéØ Summary

This library is actually a neat early attempt at making multiprocessing pipelines ergonomic. But the core issues (bad `super()`, spin-loops, fragile exception handling, raw frame queuing) explain why it was buggy in production. With a rewrite on top of `multiprocessing`/`concurrent.futures` + `asyncio`, you could salvage the nice pipeline API and dump the unsafe internals.

Want me to sketch a **modernized mini-version of `EZ/F`** (say \~200 lines) that keeps your declarative DAG flavor but uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` and `asyncio` for sane plumbing? That‚Äôd give you the closure of seeing ‚Äúwhat it should have been.‚Äù
